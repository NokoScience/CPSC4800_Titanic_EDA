# Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis

## About the Project

This project is part of an academic exercise in which the usage of Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib libraries of Python are used
to perform an Exploratory Data Analyisis (EDA) in a given dataset, the famous Kaggle's Titanic dataset.

During the EDA, some graphs are plotted to visualize the behaviour of all variables and three variables are reviewed to see if
they are associated with the survaval rate of the passengers.

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

You need to install Python in your machine, and create an environment with libraries Pandas, Seaborn and Jupyter. This can be
achieved easily installing Anaconda, a distribution of Python that comes with these libraries, and many more, already installed.
You can install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) version that's more appropiate for yourself from their website.

## Navigation

The repo has four folders, in which you will find:

* [src](https://github.com/NokoScience/CPSC4800_Titanic_EDA/tree/main/src): the Jupyter Notebooks with the source code for the EDA.
* [data](https://github.com/NokoScience/CPSC4800_Titanic_EDA/tree/main/data): the Titanic dataset used i nthe project.
* [result](https://github.com/NokoScience/CPSC4800_Titanic_EDA/tree/main/result): the different plots and a written report with the findings.
* [doc](https://github.com/NokoScience/CPSC4800_Titanic_EDA/tree/main/doc): further documentation of the project. At the moment of writing, only a copy of this README file is in it.
